# go-sensors-parser
This open - source repo uses Golang to parse Linux sensors command output. As raw sensor data is hard to integrate into apps, our project simplifies it. Leveraging Golang's performance and concurrency, we've built functions and libraries with an easy - to - use API for system monitoring and hardware projects.
